AREA OR PARAMETER

You are given the length and width of a 4-sided polygon. The polygon can either be a rectangle or a square.
If it is a square, return its area. If it is a rectangle, return its perimeter.

area_or_perimeter(6, 10) --> 32
area_or_perimeter(4, 4) --> 16

Note: You will assume that it is a square if its length and width are equal, otherwise it is a rectangle.
