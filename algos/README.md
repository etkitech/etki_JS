## TO DO 

### one time

* fork and clone the repo 

### weekly

1. fetch and pull the changes in remote to your local
2. check the latest algo that is added to the repo every Sunday
3. write unit tests with jest (preferably in a separate file)
4. write your function(s) to solve the algo
5. test your code
  * if you pass all the tests, try to make your code more efficient and cleaner
  * if not, debug and turn back to step 3 or 5 until all tests work
  * if stuck, reach out for help
6. push your solution and make a pull request
7. check other accepted solutions
8. discuss the solutions on slack (if necessary)
9. feel welcome to contact the team for questions and feedback ;)
